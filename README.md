# Ludito iOS Test Task

This project is a test assignment for **Ludito**, implementing a map-based address book feature using **Yandex Maps**. The goal is to replicate behavior similar to **Yandex GO**, including a center pin, address search, and local storage.

## ✅ Features

- 🗺️ **Yandex Maps Integration**  
  Integrated using `YandexMapsMobile` SDK

- 🔎 **Search on Map**  
  Real-time address search using `YMKSearchManager`

- 📍 **Static Center Pin**  
  Center pin stays fixed while the map moves, address updates dynamically

- 📚 **Local Address Book**  
  Add/Delete addresses using `CoreData`

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **UIKit** – Interface building
- **MVVM** – Code architecture
- **YandexMapsMobile** – Map and geocoding/search
- **SnapKit** – Layout management
- **CoreData** – Local database for address book
